 Build an application that uses jQuery to do the following:

- Contains a form with two inputs for a title and rating along with a button to submit the form.
- When the form is submitted, capture the values for each of the inputs and append them to the DOM along with a button to remove each title and rating from the DOM.
- When the button to remove is clicked, remove each title and rating from the DOM.
